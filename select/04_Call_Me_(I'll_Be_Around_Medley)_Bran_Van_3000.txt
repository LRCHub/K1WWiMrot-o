Have you seen a forty we're moving into motion
Have You seen a forty we're moving into motion
(Muffled Laughter)

Big blue ocean
And big blue sea
And big old mountains
Covering big beautiful trees
Its a big big love I have for you
Its a big big love that makes me do
The things i do to you
Things we do

Theres been so many things on our minds these days
So many moves so many ways
But if I'm coming to you in this way I just want to tell you see
I just want to drop the bull
And tell you for real this heart is full
I know I know we're falling
Sometimes i feel the club calling Lets go

Chorus
Whenever you call me I'll be there
Whenever you need me I'll be there
Whenever you call me I'll be there
See I'll be around

You've been thinking me and you could be real
And baby tell me to deal
I wanna know just how you feel Girl
You have been treated bad by your man
So baby just take my hand
I want to take you to Love Land
So later just call me
(Feel the club calling)

Chorus

Listen!
Well like a pick up pick up
When you pick up pick
Before they get the lion a ding
Make my cell 'a' phone ring
Someone hear bob marley sing
Cannot make me waitin' baby in dis room
Insane boyfriend def on yo brain Maximilian keep it plain
Take my number again pretty girl
Better not loose it again
Lovin' lovin' givin' the lovin' lovin'
Baby how you gonna respond
You know like an addiction
You know we gonna do it this time
Time for you a true yard man
Guaranteed with Armstrong
Work it hard and Grind Long
Roll up a Cheech and Chong
Tired of the wicked man you deal with meet mister All Night long

C'est toujours une belle tendre première fois (it's always a sweet, beautiful, first time)

The club calls

Chorus

Listen!

The Clubs Callin' Lets go
