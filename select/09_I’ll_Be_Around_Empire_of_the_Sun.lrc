[00:17.19] When I was young
[00:21.29] The feeling was there
[00:25.15] It is still there
[00:29.44] Unweaving in me
[00:36.94] 
[00:33.51] As I recollect
[00:37.53] Take me back to the stems of it
[00:41.16] Through the eyes of my parents' tongues
[00:46.05] How I listened to them
[00:57.05] 
[00:49.15] So I made up my mind
[00:50.10] I'll be around for a while
[00:56.26] You can bet on your life
[00:58.20] I'll be around for a while
[01:11.20] 
[01:19.39] Call out my name, when you call I'll be there
[01:25.46] I'm always running, chasing flames on a dare
[01:29.48] Come back gimme light, come on darling shine
[01:33.47] Call out my name, when you call I'll be there
[01:55.97] 
[01:38.42] So I made up my mind
[01:39.52] I'll be around for a while
[01:45.57] You can bet on your life
[01:48.56] I'll be around for a while
[02:01.56] 
[01:53.64] Time after time
[01:56.66] This love tonight
[02:04.61] It will be around for a while
[02:19.11] 
[02:11.76] If wishes were horses then beggars would ride
[02:14.78] Let your inner mystic unravel tonight
[02:18.76] Harder than diamonds, we cut up the sky
[02:22.75] Running like a river white hot with desire
[02:43.75] 
[02:35.83] So I made up my mind
[02:37.85] I'll be around for a while
[02:42.90] You can bet on your life
[02:45.98] I'll be around for a while
[02:58.98] 
[02:51.94] Time after time
[02:53.99] This love tonight
[03:02.03] It will be around for a while
[03:16.53] 
[03:25.18] Really need to say, oh
[03:33.21] Are you saying things have changed my ways again
[03:38.16] Really need to say
[03:41.25] (Really need to say)
[03:51.25] 
[03:42.36] Girl I've prayed, oh
[03:50.32] Prayed I'd meet someone like you someday
[03:54.35] That's all I need to say
[03:55.33] (That's all I need, that's all I need)
[04:14.33] 
[03:58.42] So I made up my mind
[04:00.34] I'll be around for a while
[04:05.40] You can bet on your life
[04:08.30] I'll be around for a while
[04:21.30] 
[04:14.41] Time after time
[04:16.52] This love tonight
[04:24.53] It will be around for a while
